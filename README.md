This project aimed to enhance the functionality of a vending machine application by integrating XML data with HTML and JavaScript to dynamically display product information. The primary objective was to enable users to search for products by their unique codes and retrieve relevant details, such as name, stock status, expiration date, price, and rating. This integration showcases the interaction between front-end elements (HTML and JavaScript) and structured data (XML), providing an efficient solution for dynamically displaying data on a webpage.
